A Roblox reinforcement learning project, and a PyTorch wrapper for Roblox reinforcement learning projects.

=======

Uses FastAPI for model <-> ROBLOX communication via HTTP requests.

ROBLOX Studio: 2000 requests/min
Timelag: >30ms

ROBLOX: 500 requests/min
Timelag: >120ms

TODO:
- Autoregressive policies
- More reinforcement learning algorithms
- Behavior trees
- Boost decision trees
- Replicate training environment (Python + Gym)
- Multi-agent
- LLMs
- Low variance network latency
- Interpreter module
- Cybersecurity

Notes:
- Off-policies found to perform better since training via ROBLOX
  worsens on-policies sample inefficiency.
- On-policies are too highly correlated and easily leads the agent
  to bias its action and converge to a suboptimal policy.

The future is independent of the past given the present.

TODO:
- Soft actor critic
- Behavior trees
- Boost decision trees
- Design more scenarios
- Replicate training environment in Python

Notes:
- Off-policies found to perform better since training via ROBLOX
  worsens on-policies sample inefficiency.
- On-policies are too highly correlated and easily leads the agent
  to bias its action and converge to a suboptimal policy.

=======

These papers are very short and accessible compared to neuroscience papers.
